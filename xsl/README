These are XSL stylesheets which will transform MARC records exported from the 
Library of Virginia's catalog and turn them into brief EAD records (ones with
no <dsc>) for upload into the Virginia Heritage Project (http://vaheritage.org). 
They were provided as a part of the MarcEdit program and are designed
to work with it. The original file was provided under the terms of the CC-0
license and the adapted file continues under that same license.
